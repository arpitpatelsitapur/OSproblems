# OSproblems

- This includes some basic problems of Operating system which were experimented in my college.
- We just did a few problems, there are many more you can do.


1. **Producer-Consumer Problem:**
   - Implement a solution where multiple producers and consumers share a fixed-size buffer.

2. **Readers-Writers Problem:**
   - Implement a solution where multiple readers can read a shared resource simultaneously, but only one writer can modify it at a time.

3. **Dining Philosophers Problem:**
   - Simulate a scenario where philosophers sitting at a dining table alternate between thinking and eating, using shared resources (forks).

4. **Synchronization of Processes:**
   - Implement a solution to synchronize multiple processes using semaphores or mutex locks.

5. **Banker's Algorithm:**
   - Implement the Banker's algorithm to avoid deadlock and ensure safe execution of processes.

6. **Page Replacement Algorithms:**
   - Implement page replacement algorithms like `FIFO`, `LRU`, and Optimal for managing memory in virtual memory systems.

7. **Disk Scheduling Algorithms:**
   - Implement disk scheduling algorithms like `FCFS`, `SSTF`, `SCAN`, and `C-SCAN` for optimizing disk access.

8. **File Allocation Table (FAT):**
   - Simulate file allocation in a `file system using a FAT structure`.

9. **Memory Management:**
   - Implement a simple memory management system, including allocation and deallocation of memory blocks.

10. **Thread Synchronization:**
    - Solve problems related to thread synchronization, such as using `semaphores` or `mutex locks`.

11. **Priority Scheduling:**
    - Implement a priority-based scheduling algorithm for processes.

12. **Shortest Job Next (SJN) Scheduling:**
    - Implement SJN scheduling algorithm to minimize the waiting time for processes.

13. **Real-Time Systems:**
    - Implement a real-time scheduling algorithm to meet deadlines for tasks.

14. **File System Implementation:**
    - Develop a simple file system with features like file creation, deletion, and directory management.

15. **Deadlock Detection and Resolution:**
    - Implement a deadlock detection and resolution mechanism in a system.

These problems cover a broad range of operating system concepts and are commonly used in educational settings or technical interviews to assess a candidate's understanding of operating system principles and problem-solving skills.
